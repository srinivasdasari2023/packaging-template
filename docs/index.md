# python template (UPDATE THIS WITH ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION RELATED INFORMATION LATER)

## Instruction on how to use this template?

 

## STEPS - 

### STEP 01: Create new repository using this template 

by choosing this as a project template while creating a new repository

### STEP 02: Clone the new repository or use codespaces

- To clone you can use the following command - 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xxx
    
    NOTE: update the repo-name here

- Click on create code spaces or select available codespaces.

### STEP 03: IMPORTANT: Create `.env` file in the root of the project and paste the following content - 

```ini
# update the following values as per your project
PROJECT_NAME=<PROJECT_NAME>
REPO_NAME=<REPO_NAME>
GITHUB_USER_NAME=<GITHUB_USER_NAME>
AUTHOR_NAME=<AUTHOR_NAME>
PACKAGE_NAME=<PACKAGE_NAME>
AUTHOR_EMAIL=<AUTHOR_EMAIL>
LICENCSE_NAME="MIT" # update as per your need, Here it is assumed that you choose MIT LICENSE
PYTHON_VERSION=3.9 # update as per your need, Here it is assumed that you choose version 3.8
YEAR=2024 # update as per your need
```

> **WARNING: if this step is skipped then exception will be raised**


### STEP 04: Run the template.py file

> NOTE: make sure you have dotenv installed before running the following command. To install it simply run the following command - 
> ```bash
> pip install python-dotenv
> ```

Use and update `template.py` as per your requirements to create the other required files by running the following command - 

```bash 
python template.py
```

> NOTE: Use `restore_original.py` to restore the templated files if required- 
> ```bash
> python restore_original.py
> ```

### STEP 05: Add a `LICENSE` file

- Go to your github repository and click on `Add file` and then select `Create new file`.
- Now start typing the name of the file as `LICENSE` and then you'll see the option of selecting the desired template. 

NOTE: You can choose MIT License if you are not sure.

> This completes the basic skeleton of the project!!

### STEP 06: Create and install dependencies - 

- It is assumed that `anaconda` or `miniconda` is intalled in the system. If not then please do your setup by following this tutorial - https://youtu.be/bVM-QujJ0AI

- Update the `requirements_dev.txt` and `requirements.txt` files with the project requirements (i.e. required libraries)
- Now run the `init_setup.sh` file by running the following command - 
    ```bash
    bash init_setup.sh   
    ```
NOTE: if in case you face difficulty in running the `init_setup.sh` file then you can run the command mentioned in it one by one in the terminal to get the same result.

> This completes the environment setup of the project!!

### STEP 07: Now you can start the development by activating the environment

- To activate the environment run the following command - 
    ```bash
    conda activate ./env
    ```

### STEP 08: Uncomment github action workflows present in `.github/workflows` directory

### STEP 09: Create new release of the project

- After developement you can create release of your project to make this project available at `pypi.org`.
- For this you will need PYPI token, which can be created from your `pypi` profile section.
- And the above token should be added to the secret variables of the repository.
